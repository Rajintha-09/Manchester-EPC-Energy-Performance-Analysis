# Manchester-EPC-Energy-Performance-Analysis
Data-driven analysis of residential building energy performance in Manchester using EPC data, SQL Server, and Power BI.

## Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of residential building energy performance in Manchester using **Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data**, SQL Server, and Power BI. The goal is to explore trends, costs, carbon emissions, and recommendations to improve energy efficiency in buildings.

## Dataset
The dataset includes EPC records of properties in Manchester from **2006–2025**, covering:
- Current and potential energy efficiency scores  
- EPC ratings (A-G)  
- CO₂ emissions  
- Energy-related expenses (heating, lighting, hot water)  
- Property and building characteristics (type, age, floor area, insulation, heating systems)

## Technologies Used
- **SQL Server:** Data storage, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visualization  
- **Excel:** Raw datasets  
- **GitHub:** Version control and project documentation

## Key Insights
- Heating is the largest contributor to total energy costs  
- Mid-terrace properties dominate the building stock  
- CO₂ emissions vary with property type, age, and construction  
- Solar panels and heating upgrades offer significant environmental and financial benefits
